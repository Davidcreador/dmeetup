# √êMeetup Whitepaper - WIP

An incentivized, blockchain-based, meetups and workshops platform.

## Problem

A lot people run communities and workshops and have to pay centralized solutions to publish and promote their events. Many of this solutions don't make easy to manage reservation and charge for the participation, and if they do most platform don't support cryptocurrencies yet, so you need to charge thru centralized payment gateways.

## Solution & Product

dmeetup is an EOS and IPFS based decentralized application that allows people to publish on-site and online meetup events and workshops. You will be able to build a reputation and get rewarded in crypto. The platform will also allow you to charge in crypto for your workshops.

It is a 100% open-source and community-driven project and we welcome contributions of all sorts. There are many ways to help, from reporting issues, improving documentation, contributing code, design/ux proposal, economic modeling and helping us improve our community.
